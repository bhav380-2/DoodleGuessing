# Sketch nâ€™ Guess
 Doodle Guessing Game is an interactive web-based application that allows users to draw doodles and receive predictions based on a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The frontend is built with **React** and connects to a FastAPI backend that processes images and serves predictions from a trained **CNN** model.
